title: Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License

description: When analysing whether a license is free or not, you usually check that it allows free usage, modification and redistribution. Then you check that the additional restrictions do not impair fundamental freedoms. The WTFPL renders this task trivial: it allows everything and has no additional restrictions. How could life be easier? You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.

how: Create a text file (typically named COPYING or COPYING.WTFPL in case multiple licenses are used) in your project with the license text, and add the wording you find at the bottom of the license in the copyright statements.
