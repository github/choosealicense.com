title: Do What The Fuck You Want Public License v2
permalink: /licenses/wtfpl/

source: http://www.wtfpl.net

description: There is a long ongoing battle between GPL zealots and BSD fanatics, about which license type is the most free of the two. In fact, both license types have unacceptable obnoxious clauses (such as reproducing a huge disclaimer that is written in all caps) that severely restrain our freedoms. The WTFPL came to solve this problem.

how: Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.

  - patent-grant
