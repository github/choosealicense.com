# The licenses on choosealicense.com are regularly imported to GitHub.com to
# be used as the list of licenses available when creating a repository. When
# we create a repository, we will replace certain strings in the license with
# variables from the repository. These can be used to create accurate copyright
# notices. The available variables are:
