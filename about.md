GitHub wants to help developers choose a license for their source code.

If you already know what you're doing and have a license you prefer to use, that's great! We're not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can help.

## Not comprehensive

This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses.  We think there are too many options, which adds to the confusion. On the homepage, we break it down into just three licenses. The vast majority of projects will likely be fine choosing from one of these three. Just in case you have specific needs not covered by those three, we also highlight a [few other licenses to consider](/licenses/).
