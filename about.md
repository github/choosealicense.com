GitHub wants to help developers choose an open source license for their source code.

If you already know what you're doing and have a license you prefer to use, that's great! We're not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of open source license choices, maybe we can help.

## Not comprehensive

This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses. We think there are too many options, which adds to the confusion. On the [homepage](/), we break it down into just three licenses. The vast majority of projects will likely be fine choosing from one of these three. Just in case you have specific needs not covered by those three, we also highlight a [few other licenses to consider](/licenses/), and have a page about [licenses for non-software projects](/non-software/).

See our [appendix](/appendix) for a table of all of the licenses cataloged in the choosealicense.com repository and the links below for *even more licenses* that you **do not** need to learn about when choosing a license for your project.
