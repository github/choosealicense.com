GitHub wants to help developers choose a license for their source code.

If you already know what you&#8217;re doing and have a license you prefer to use, that&#8217;s great! We&#8217;re not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can help.

## Not comprehensive

This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses.  We think there are too many options, which adds to the confusion. On the homepage, we break it down into just three licenses. The vast majority of projects will likely be fine choosing from one of these three. Just in case you have specific needs not covered by those three, we also highlight a [few other licenses to consider](/licenses/).  Additional resources:

* [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/licenses/) - comprehensive list of open source licenses
* [Comparison of free and open-source software licenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) on Wikipedia
* [License differentiator](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff/) from [OSS Watch](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/)
* [TLDRLegal](http://www.tldrlegal.com/)

## Disclaimer

We are not lawyers. Well most of us anyways. It is not the goal of this site to provide legal advice. The goal of this site is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice by providing information on popular open source licenses. If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, it&#8217;s always best to consult with a professional.
