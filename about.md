GitHub wants to help developers choose an open source license for their source code.

If you already know what you're doing and have a license you prefer to use, that's great! We're not here to change your mind. But if you are bewildered by the large number of choices, maybe we can help.

## Not comprehensive

This site is not a comprehensive directory of open source licenses. The vast majority of projects will likely be well served by one of the three options highlighted on the [homepage](/) â€” choosing the license [preferred](/community/) by projects similar to yours, or the most popular permissive license ([MIT](/licenses/mit/)), or the most popular copyleft license ([GNU GPLv3](/licenses/gpl-3.0/)). Just in case you have specific needs not covered by these, we also highlight a [few other licenses to consider](/licenses/) and have a page about [licenses for non-software projects](/non-software/).

See our [appendix](/appendix/) for a table of every license cataloged in the [choosealicense.com repository](https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com) and the links below for *even more* licenses that you **do not** need to learn about to still choose a great license for your project.
