description: The Open Font License (OFL) is a mild copyleft license made specifically for typeface design and font engineering. Unlike other licenses, it provides unique features dedicated to the needs of font designers and script engineers. It enables font authors to release their work under a well-established common libre license that allows use, bundling, embedding, modification and redistribution. It encourages shared value and is not limited to any specific computing platform or environment. It has been validated by the Debian, FSF and OSI. It is already used by many open font projects created by independent font developers, small foundries as well as big corporations like Adobe, Google and Mozilla. 

note: This license doesn't require source provision (i.e. providing every single source file in every format used - including intermediary files and opaque proprietary formats - with the corresponding buildpath), but highly recommends it via best practices (providing the most preferred forms for modification including build scripts and related documentation). Everything derived from OFL files inherits the license and must remain under the OFL.

how: Create a text file (typically OFL.txt) in the root of your source and copy the text of the license into the file. Fill in the header with [year], [fullname] and [email] with your information as the copyright holder (you can also add a URL to your upstream project website). As a copyright holder, you may choose to declare one - or more - Reserved Font Name(s) by adding "with Reserved Font Name &lt;Reserved Font Name&gt;" under your copyright statement. This is an optional feature which requires other developers who make modifications to change the font name and pick their own unique name to prevent collisions and respect your canonical branch. When developing an open font collaboratively in a public repository, you can also use a development name that is different from the release name which users expect to be stable. Documenting changes in a FONTLOG.txt file is recommended. See the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web">OFL-FAQ</a> for more details and practical tips.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
