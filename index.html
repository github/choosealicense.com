    <p>
      The <a href="licenses/mit">MIT License</a> is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable.
    </p>

      {% include using-sentence.html license-id="mit" %}

      <h3>I’m concerned about patents.</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      The <a href="licenses/apache-2.0/">Apache License 2.0</a> is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.

      <h3>I care about legally enforcing sharing improvements.</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      The <a href="licenses/gpl-3.0/">GNU GPLv3</a> is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms, and also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.
