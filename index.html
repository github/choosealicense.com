  <span>{</span>
  Which of the following best describes your situation?
  <span>}</span>
</h2>
<ul class="situations cf">
  <li class='whatever'>
    <a href="licenses/mit"><img height='57' src='images/three-arrows@2x.png' width='72'></a>
    <h3><a href="licenses/mit">I want it simple and permissive.</a></h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="licenses/mit">MIT License</a> is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>jQuery</strong> and <strong>Rails</strong> use the MIT&nbsp;License.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class='patents'>
    <a href="licenses/apache"><img height='72' src='images/lightbulb@2x.png' width='43'></a>
    <h3><a href="licenses/apache">I’m concerned about patents.</a></h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="licenses/apache/">Apache License</a> is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Apache</strong>, <strong>SVN</strong>, and <strong>NuGet</strong> use the Apache&nbsp;License.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class='copyleft'>
    <a href="licenses/gpl-v2"><img height='69' src='images/circular@2x.png' width='72'></a>
    <h3><a href="licenses/gpl-v2">I care about sharing improvements.</a></h3>
    <p>
      The GPL (<a href="licenses/gpl-v2">V2</a> or <a href="licenses/gpl-v3">V3</a>) is a copyleft license that requires others who modify your code to disclose their changes if they redistribute it in source or binary form. V3 is similar to V2, but further restricts use in hardware that forbids software alterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and <strong>WordPress</strong> use the GPL.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="see-more callout">
  <p>What if none of these work for me or I want to retain all of my rights? <a href="licenses">More licenses are available</a>.</p>

  <p>What if I don't want to choose a license? <a href="no-license">You don't have to</a>.</p>
